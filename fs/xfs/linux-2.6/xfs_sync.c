/*
 * xfs_sync flushes any pending I/O to file system vfsp.
 *
 * This routine is called by vfs_sync() to make sure that things make it
 * out to disk eventually, on sync() system calls to flush out everything,
 * and when the file system is unmounted.  For the vfs_sync() case, all
 * we really need to do is sync out the log to make all of our meta-data
 * updates permanent (except for timestamps).  For calls from pflushd(),
 * dirty pages are kept moving by calling pdflush() on the inodes
 * containing them.  We also flush the inodes that we can lock without
 * sleeping and the superblock if we can lock it without sleeping from
 * vfs_sync() so that items at the tail of the log are always moving out.
 *
 * Flags:
 *      SYNC_BDFLUSH - We're being called from vfs_sync() so we don't want
 *		       to sleep if we can help it.  All we really need
 *		       to do is ensure that the log is synced at least
 *		       periodically.  We also push the inodes and
 *		       superblock if we can lock them without sleeping
 *			and they are not pinned.
 *      SYNC_ATTR    - We need to flush the inodes.  If SYNC_BDFLUSH is not
 *		       set, then we really want to lock each inode and flush
 *		       it.
 *      SYNC_WAIT    - All the flushes that take place in this call should
 *		       be synchronous.
 *      SYNC_DELWRI  - This tells us to push dirty pages associated with
 *		       inodes.  SYNC_WAIT and SYNC_BDFLUSH are used to
 *		       determine if they should be flushed sync, async, or
 *		       delwri.
 *      SYNC_CLOSE   - This flag is passed when the system is being
 *		       unmounted.  We should sync and invalidate everything.
 *      SYNC_FSDATA  - This indicates that the caller would like to make
 *		       sure the superblock is safe on disk.  We can ensure
 *		       this by simply making sure the log gets flushed
 *		       if SYNC_BDFLUSH is set, and by actually writing it
 *		       out otherwise.
 *	SYNC_IOWAIT  - The caller wants us to wait for all data I/O to complete
 *		       before we return (including direct I/O). Forms the drain
 *		       side of the write barrier needed to safely quiesce the
 *		       filesystem.
